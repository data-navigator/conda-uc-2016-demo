Python {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
======

Why Python? ![](images/logos/Python_64x64.png){class="tight"} {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
-----------

 - Accessible for new-comers, and the [most taught first language in US universites](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext)
 - Extensive package collection (56 thousand on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)), broad user-base
 - Strong glue language used to bind together many environments, both open source and commercial
 - Open source with liberal license &mdash; do what you want

Why Python? ![](images/logos/Python_64x64.png){class="tight"} {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
-----------

In the box:

 - The SciPy Stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, matplotlib, sympy)

    + [Scientific Programming with the SciPy Stack](https://4326.us/esri/scipy/#/)

 - xlrd, netCDF4, requests, PyPDF, pytz

Package Management for Python {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
----------------------------

Why not ``pip``, wheels, virtualenvs?

 - Don't handle the harder problem of system dependencies, considered out of scope by Python packagers --- does it end up in ``site-packages``?
 - Package devs: On OSX and Linux, 'easy' to get the deps! Use a system package manager (e.g. ``apt``, ``brew``, ``yum``) and the included compiler (e.g. ``clang``, ``gcc``).
 - It's still not easy to make reproducible builds, and what about Windows?

What about Windows? {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
-------------------

 * We are particularly stuck on Windows which lacks broadly used package management 
 * Only developers have a C compiler on their machine
 * A hard problem

. . .

 * Enter Conda

Why Conda? {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
----------

![](images/logos/continuum_analytics.png){style="width: 200px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);"}

* Scientific Python community identified that there was a gap not being addressed by the core Python infrastructure, limiting their ability to get packages into the hands of users

* Industry standard built by people who care about this space &mdash; Continuum Analytics

Why Conda? {data-background="images/Picture2.jpg"}
----------

![](images/logos/continuum_analytics.png){style="width: 200px; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);"}

* It solves a hard problem:

 - Handles dependencies for many languages (C, C++, R and of course Python)
 - Built for Python first, but it really solves a much broader infrastructural issue.


Conda {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
=====

Conda ![](images/logos/anaconda_mini.png){class="tight"} {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----

 - Cross-platform: simply develop recipes for building and installing software on Linux, OS X and Windows.
 - Open source: Esri is using it, you can use it in your own projects for other contexts

What can it install?  Not just scientific packages. It can help with:

 - GUI toolkits (PyQt, TKinter)
 - C++ Libraries (Boost)
 - IDEs (Spyder, Juptyer)

Conda ![](images/logos/anaconda_mini.png){class="tight"} {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
--------------

 + Environments: Can isolate a Python environment, flexibly make changes withot affecting installed software.
 + Requirements &mdash; include explicit state information, not just the package name. Names aren't enough!
 + Also handles platforms and Jupyter notebooks

How Does it Work? {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----------------

Conda packages can come from a variety of locations:

 - On disk (``file://``)
 - Public repositories (Anaconda Cloud, self-hosted)
 - Private repositories
 - [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org)

Conda Basics {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
------------

Activating environments, a couple ways:

 * Use the shortcuts
 * Manually activate the environment:

```sh
    cd C:\ArcGIS\bin\Python\Scripts
    activate arcgispro-py3
```

Conda Basics {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
------------

To start:

    conda --help

* A collection of packages and Python install is called an *environment* or *env*, the building block for managing Python with Conda
* Can have multiple environments and seamlessly switch between them


Conda Basics {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
------------

Once you're in an environment get details with ``info``:

    conda info

Conda info is the starting point &mdash; it tells you the state of the environment.

Conda Basics {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
------------

Creating new environments:

 - A few different ways. Can manually specify the dependencies:

```
    conda create --name my_env python=3.4 numpy flask dask
```
 - Can also use a file which includes all the dependencies:
```
    conda create --name my_env --file my_sweet_depends.txt
```
These can contain explcit information about channels, to ensure that 
the new environment precisely matches the requirements.

Conda vs... {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----------

Name | Means | Will Ship?
-|-|-
Conda | The command itself | ✓
Miniconda | A minimum set of Python packages to build and run Conda. | ✓
Anaconda | A distribution 200+ packages built with Conda | &nbsp;
Anaconda Server | Host the full infrastructure internally | &nbsp;

Skikit Learn Demo {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----------------

 - Have tweets about an iOS app released at #SXSW
 - What to people think of it? Use a naive bayes classifier to determine sentiment

Skikit Learn Demo {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----------------

```python
# Scikit learn model based Lukas Biewald's Scikit Learn class
# https://github.com/lukas/scikit-class

import arcpy
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

input_csv = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0)
test_string = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(1)

df = pd.read_csv(input_csv)
target = df['is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product']
text = df['tweet_text']
```

Skikit Learn Demo {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----------------

```python
fixed_text = text[pd.notnull(text)]
fixed_target = target[pd.notnull(text)]

count_vect = CountVectorizer()
count_vect.fit(fixed_text)
counts = count_vect.transform(fixed_text)

nb = MultinomialNB()
nb.fit(counts, fixed_target)

# print out our prediction
arcpy.AddMessage(nb.predict(count_vect.transform([test_string][0])))
```

Multiple Pythons {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
----------------

Currently:

Platform | Python version
--------|--------
Desktop |  Python 2.7.x (2.7.10)
Pro | Python 3.4.x (3.4.3)

Multiple Pythons {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
----------------

Upgrade code?  [Python migration for ArcGIS Pro](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/python-migration-for-arcgis-pro.htm)

 - Do it! You can support 2 + 3 without that much work
 - Still need to change ``arcpy.mapping`` to ``arcpy.mp`` when moving from Desktop to Pro, but no Python language level changes needed.
. . .

<br> 
But... this can be costly. For many organizations, a significant burden, even if the
language changes are relatively small. Multiple Pythons is a solution to this.

Challenges {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
----------

Have to make sure you're running the right Python (_what happens when you type ``python`` at the command line?_)

 - Working to make this easy as possible
 - It'll be easy to tell in app
 - Isolated installation fixes a variety of issues

Requires some user education over the "only one Python on the box" model

What Do I Get Out of the Box? {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-----------------------------

* Conda command and a Conda root Python install
* New modules (e.g. ``requests``)
* Conda environment with all of the ArcGIS Pro dependencies as Conda packages

How can I use this? {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
-------------------

 * We already ship you the SciPy stack &mdash; powerful and out of the box, can use today (Pro and 10.4)
 * Can start using ``conda`` today. Miniconda is fully stand-alone, won't affect your global Python (unless you tell it to)
 * Package your work: this is an opportunity to distribute it, possibly including commercial side as well.

Where Can I Run This? {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
---------------------

![](images/arcgis-pro-icon.png){class="tight" style="padding: 5px"}

 * ArcGIS Pro 1.3
    - Will be _the_ Python install.

 * Future:
    - UI for interaction
    - Take advantage of more features
    - Integration with platform

from future import * {data-background="images/Picture5.jpg"}
--------------------

Effectively manage complex software dependencies with Conda. Thousands of packages exist today, can integrate it into your organization's needs.
